A couple years ago, the tidyverse team began migrating to the cli R package for raising errors, transitioning away from base R (e.g. `stop()`), rlang (e.g. `rlang::abort()`), glue, and homegrown combinations of them. cli's new syntax is easier to work with as a developer and more visually pleasing as a user.

In some cases, transitioning is as simple as Finding + Replacing `rlang::abort()` to `cli::cli_abort()`. In others, there's a mess of ah-hoc pluralization, `paste0()`s, glue interpolations, and other assorted nonsense to sort through. Total pain, especially with thousands upon thousands of error messages thrown across the tidyverse, r-lib, and tidymodels organizations.

clipal ("c-l-i pal") is an RStudio add-in that helps you convert your R package to use cli for error messages. It's vaguely correct most of the time, and greatly speeds up the process for converting error messages to cli, in my experience.

## Installation

You can install clipal like so:

``` r
pak::pak("simonpcouch/clipal")
```

Then,

* Ensure that you have an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set in your [`.env`](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/dotenv). If you're using a different LLM to power the cli pal, see `?cli_pal()` to set default metadata on that model. 
* Assign the "Convert to cli" addin the shortcut "Ctrl+Shift+C".

## Example

### RStudio Add-in

The package provides an RStudio add-in "Convert to cli" that we suggest registering with the keybinding "Ctrl+Shift+C". To do so, navigate to Tools > Modify Keyboard Shortcuts > Search "Convert to cli", and add the keybinding. After selecting some code, press the keyboard shortcut and wait a moment:

### In code

The `cli_pal()` function instantiates a cli pal and is a light wrapper around functions creating [elmer](https://github.com/hadley/elmer) chats.

```{r}
library(clipal)

cli_pal()
```

By default, `cli_pal()` uses Claude Sonnet 3.5 via `elmer::new_chat_claude()`, though users can choose other models. Then, the `convert_to_cli()` function takes an R expression that raises a condition and converts it to use cli. At its simplest:

```{r}
convert_to_cli(stop("An error message."))
```

The function knows to look for the most recently defined cli pal, but you can pass one manually via `convert_to_cli(cli_pal)` if you please. 

It can handle surprisingly complex erroring code, too. For example, some `paste0()` enumeration and strange line breaking is no issue:

```{r}
convert_to_cli({
  types <- paste0(pred_types, collapse = ", ")
  rlang::abort(
    glue::glue(
      "The model only has prediction types {types}. Did you ",
      "fit the model with `silly_head = TRUE`?"
    )
  )
})
```

It seems to have a decent hold on sprintf-style statements, too:

```{r}
convert_to_cli({
  abort(sprintf("No such '%s' function: `%s()`.", package, name))
})
```
