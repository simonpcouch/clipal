Description: There have been many interfaces to raise errors with R over the
    years. A couple years ago, the tidyteam converged on using the 'cli' 
    package and began the cumbersome process of rewriting erroring code.
    This task is a difficult one to automate, as there are all sorts of weird
    edge cases and stylistic divergences; "every unhappy family is 
    unhappy in its own way." This RStudio add-in helps you convert your R code 
    to use the 'cli' package for error messages using LLMs.
